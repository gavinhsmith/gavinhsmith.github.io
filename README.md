## Welcome to my Website!

I am currently working on an actual website right now, so my README is all I have to use in its place.

## Q&A!

### Why do you code?

>"Coding sucks, but I am addicted to it. Don't do coding, kids: it will make people scared of your nerd words." - Gavin H. Smith, 2019

In all reality, I have always found it fun to learn how computers work. When I was in 5th grade, I started to mess around with the windows console, and everything stemed off from there. I learned basic web development using JavaScript, and I also learned Python and Java for a few other personal projects. I enjoy working on the server side of an application most, but I *can* work on the client if needed (I am not great at front-end development). 

### What type of personality do you have?

I ride off the waves of early-2010s lol-random internet cartoons, and that transfered into my vast enjoyment of modern memes. I like the math around physics and things like that.

### Coding Sucks. Why?

Yes.

### What can you do?

I work best in the server environment, using Java, Python, and JavaScript.

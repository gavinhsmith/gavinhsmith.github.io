## Welcome to my Website!

I am currently working on an actual website right now, so my readme is all I have to use in its place.

## Q&A

### Why do you code?

>"Coding sucks, but I am addicted to it. Don't do coding, kids: it will make people scared of your nerd words." - Gavin H. Smith, 2019

In all reality, I have always found it fun to learn how computers work. I started with Windows Command Prompt, and am now starting to get into C++ and have already got a pretty good grasp on Web Languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript/TypeScript. If you ever find yourself interested in computer engenering or programming, don't be afraid to jump in head first. After all, you'll never know if you like it until you try it.

### What type of personality do you have?

I ride off the waves of early-2010s lol-random internet cartoons, and that transfered into my vast enjoyment of modern memes [like this one](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/juan-horse-on-balcony/). I don't talk to many people, I like working on game mechanics, and have a lot of fun working with the others in my [very, VERY bad "game" studio](https://indienile-games.github.io/).

### Coding Sucks. Why?

Yes.
